   "details":"SpaceX's 16th Crew Resupply Mission on behalf of NASA, with a total of 20 contracted flights. This will bring essential supplies to the International Space Station using SpaceX's reusable Dragon spacecraft. The Falcon 9 will launch from SLC-40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. During the landing of the first stage, a grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, causing the core to enter an uncontrolled roll, and resulting in a (succesful) water landing."
